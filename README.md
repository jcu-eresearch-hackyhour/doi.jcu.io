About
-----
cDoi is a research project to create personal DOI to cite for collaborations to research.

We are trying to reward all contributions to research; like helping code for a day, being a lab tech or suffering in the field.

Acknowledgements are nice but nobody reads them or gets promotions or recognition from the research community.

2. Run `npm start`.
3. It should now be running at `localhost:8080`.
